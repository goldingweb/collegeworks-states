							College Works Painting is without a doubt the most rewarding and beneficial job I have ever had. I have since graduated from West Chester University with a degree in Business Management, interviewed for scholarships and jobs, and gotten more offers than I could have ever imagined. College Works Painting gives you the chance to make great money, lasting memories, amazing friends, and have an unforgettable experience. It also gives you something that you can't find other places: options. At a time when people are struggling to find jobs and getting rejection after rejection, I was offered job after job.
