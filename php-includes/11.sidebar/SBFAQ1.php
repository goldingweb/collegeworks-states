					<p class="last"><b>Q:</b> Q:How do I get paid?</p>
					<p class="last"><b>A:</b> At training you will learn how to price a paint job. You will be taught how to calculate wages, material, supplies and your profit. The average house will cost approximately $3,200 and you aim to earn 20% of this selling price per house painted. Remember as in any business, your profit margin depends entirely on how well you manage your costs. (Note: CWP cannot guarantee how much you will make, as it is dependent upon how you price the job and the costs you incur in delivering it. However, the average profit last year was 22.5%)</p>
