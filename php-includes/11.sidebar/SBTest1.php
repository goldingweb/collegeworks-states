                    <h3>Testimonial</h3>
					<div class="testimonial">
						<div class="text-area small">
							I worked for College Works Painting, PA, for almost two years before starting with Deloitte Consulting, part of the largest professional services firm on the planet. I have traveled all over the country over the last two years, and currently fly from Montreal to Chicago every week for international software implementation, leveraging skills that no other program could have taught me as a college student. Belonging to a firm that only hires the top 5% of talent in the country, I owe being at the forefront of my class completely to College Works Painting.
