						<h1>What's It Like</h1>
						
						<p class="last">Concerned about your lack of experience? Maybe a bit intimidated? Don't be. Few College Works Painting candidates have had any management experience. That is what we teach. Rest assured, if you possess the desire, background, work ethic, outgoing personality and drive to succeed, you'll fit right in as one of our interns, and go far with us.</p>

			        <h3>Adventure and Fun</h3>
			        <p>At College Works Painting we believe in <a href="<?php echo $studentsAdventure; ?>">preparing our Student Interns for life and business</a>, and we believe the old adage that those who "<a href="<?php echo $workHard; ?>">Work Hard should Play Hard</a>" too.  As such, since we know how hard you will be working, we want you to know how much fun can be had as well.</p>

			        <h3>Interviewing</h3>
			        <p>College Works Painting Interns are chosen based on a strict process involving three face-to-face interviews with various company representatives. Not all college students are capable of the responsibilities involved in working a summer with College Works Painting. To make sure we only select the best, most motivated candidates to join our program, we'll carefully consider your work experience, academic performance, involvement in high school and college activities, along with many personal factors.</p>
			        
			        <h3>Training</h3>
			        <p>Once you've been selected for our Intern Program, you can look forward to extensive training--in the classroom, and in the field with one of our district managers--to prepare you for your upcoming College Works Painting experience.</p>
			        
			        <h4>Management Training</h4>
			        <p>Next, we'll teach you exactly how to craft and implement a marketing program, make sales, estimate projects, work with customers, plus recruit, hire, and train employees. In short, you'll learn all aspects of running a small business.</p>
			        
			        <p>Our carefully designed training program provides one of the best proving grounds available, where you'll be challenged to test your limits in a real managerial role. Once you're done, you'll be fully prepared to go out and achieve the personal and professional growth necessary for success in today's competitive world.</p>
			        
			        <h3>District Manager Support</h3>
			        <p>Pass the College Works Painting training program and you'll be expected to perform and produce like the true entrepreneur you are. But you won't be out there alone. You'll continue to work closely with your district manager, who will provide strong and structured mentorship, ongoing in-field training, and supervised learning.</p>
			        
			        <h3>Your Earning Potential</h3>
			        <p>How much money can I make? It depends entirely on how profitably you run your College Works Painting business, not the number of hours you work. But the following chart will give you a better idea.</p>
