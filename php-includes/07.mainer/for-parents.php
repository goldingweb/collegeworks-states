					<p>Most internships impart few meaningful job skills or compensation. But the College Works Painting experience does both. It gives your student the chance to earn serious money to help pay for school. And because we invest in the training, marketing, mentoring, licensing and insurance, there's no financial risk to them or you. Students are immersed into a total management experience. If your child would like to be a leader in his or her professional life, College Works Painting may be the best preparation for them.</p>
					
					<p>What's more, since many work summers to help pay for the following school year, we offer a minimum compensation guarantee of $2,500 to those who fulfill program requirements.</p>
					
					<p>Your student will also receive extensive safety training. In fact, we've been a leader in creating new, better safety standards for the entire home painting industry. We're fully <a href="http://www.osha.gov/" title="OSHA-compliant">OSHA-compliant</a> and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/lead/index.html" title="EPA Lead-Safe">EPA Lead-Safe Certified</a> as well.</p>

					<br />
					
					<p>In short, a College Works Painting internship is a highly rewarding experience that will help prepare your student for long-term success by teaching invaluable business and life skills.</p>
					
					<p>You'll be proud they're part of this program. And so will your student!</p>
