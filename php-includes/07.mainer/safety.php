						<h1>Safety</h1>
						<p><strong>We work safe and smart &mdash; right from square one.</strong></p>
						<p class="last">Sound workplace safety benefits everyone &mdash; our student crews and their parents, our company's solid reputation, plus the homeowners whose houses we paint. So you'll be pleased to learn that at College Works Painting, safety is our number one priority. In fact, our safety education and practices have made us a leader in creating new, better standards for the entire home painting industry, a claim many contractors simply can't make.</p>

					<h3>EPA Lead-Safe Certification</h3>
					<p>Federal law requires that contractors performing renovation, repair and painting projects that disturb more than six square feet of paint in homes, child care facilities and schools built before 1978 must be certified and trained to follow specific work practices to prevent lead contamination.</p>
					<p>You can rest assured that College Works Painting follows the law to the letter, and is fully EPA Lead- Safe-Certified.</p>

					<h3>Electrocution Hazard Prevention</h3>
					<p>Metal ladders can pose a serious electrocution risk in the wrong situation. But at College Works Painting we take no chances, and allow nothing but fiberglass ladders on our jobsites.</p>
					<h3>Complete OSHA Compliance</h3>
					<p>College Works Painting actively works to meet and exceed all OSHA requirements for residential house painting with frequent job site safety meetings, the use of harnesses while working on roofs, and comprehensive reporting of injuries and illnesses.</p>
					<h3>Regular Safety Meetings</h3>
					<p>Safety seminars are an important part of the initial training every intern and crew member must undergo, and are also held every week on every jobsite. That's twice what OSHA requires!</p>
					<h3>Our Comprehensive Safety Manual</h3>
					<p>At College Works Painting, we do more than just talk about safety. All employees must receive, review and constantly heed our comprehensive safety manual.</p>
