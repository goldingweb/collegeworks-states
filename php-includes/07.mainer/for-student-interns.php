						<h2>College Student Painters</h2>
						
						<p>College Works Painting provide a one-of-a-kind opportunity for college-aged students while they are on summer break from classes to challenge themselves and run their very own painting franchise.</p>

						<p>With College Works Painting, you'll be trained in the tricks of the trade of owning a business, experience you can take with you into any prospective career. It's not only a seasonal summer job. The real life skill you obtain running a business skill during a summer season of demanding responsbilities will lay the groundwork for a lot of future successes.</p>
						
						<p class="last">Since 1987 College Works has been in the business of providing extraordinary training in leadership and management to college-aged entrepreneurs by way of real-world work experiences. We are aware, that as a responsible student, your foremost priority is your education, and College Work's training course has been tailored for college students during the time they are in class. As an example, a student's obligation in the spring semester is similar to being an active member of student council or participating in a varsity or Division I or II team sport, or employed in a demanding part-time position. We truly prefer students who are able to deal with the demands of the job: of the more than 10,000 college students who apply for the internship, we decide on just 500 to be selected to manage a crew.</p>
