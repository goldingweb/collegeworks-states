					<h2 class="h2-lrg">Questions for Homeowners</h2>
					<h3 id="question1">How do your prices compare to other contractors?</h3>
					<p>College Works prices are very competitive when you are comparing the same service. College Works Painting uses only 100% Acrylic Paints from the top manufacturers like Kelly-Moore, Glidden, ICI, Sherwin Willams and Parker Paints. We focus on only top notch preparation in order to make your job last and we carry full workers compensation coverage as well as $1,000,000 in liability insurance. When you combine this with a 2 year guarantee and compare us to other contractors we know you will find us to be the best value around.</p>
					
					<h3 id="question2">How does your guarantee work?</h3>
					<p>The Guarantee of Quality is backed by the company, which means that if anything goes wrong with your job as a result of work we performed the company will fix it free of charge for labor and materials for 2 full years. Most companies offer a "paint only" guarantee, whereas College Works Painting makes sure the painting job on your home will last for years.</p>
					
					<h3 id="question3">Are they really students?</h3>
					<p>All of the College Works Branch Operators are college students. The program is designed to allow college students to have a real life business experience and to earn money for the high cost of tuition. The painters on each crew may or may not be college students and have experience ranging up to 8-10 years.</p>
					
					<h3 id="question4">Will they be practicing on my home? Are they just learning to paint?</h3>
					<p>Each Branch Operator is put through an extensive training program during the spring months so they are completely prepared to take care of your home. The experience of the painters varies, however we will not leave inexperienced people to paint your home. We guarantee that you, like thousands of others, will be happy with our work.</p>
					
					<h3 id="question5">Do we paint interiors? Do you mow lawns, handyman work, etc.?</h3>
					<p>No, we focus on what we do best, outdoor painting.</p>
					
					<h3 id="question6">Why should I not hire a "professional" painter or someone who has been painting longer?</h3>
					<p>Once you take a thorough look at the College Works Painting Program we believe you'll agree that no other painting company is as thorough or has the training or does the screening that College Works Painting does with its employees. Professionalism by definition has little to do with how long someone has been doing a particular job but more to do with how serious, committed and well trained they are. By this definition and the fact that College Works Painting one of the largest residential painting companies in the nation, painting 2000 homes in the last 2 years, College Works Painting is the company by which others judge themselves.</p>
					
					<h3 id="question7">What kind of safety precautions do you have?</h3>
					<p>Safety is the most important part of any job. College Works Painting's Safety Program includes on-site manuals and weekly safety briefings of which are the most advanced in the industry. Feel free to ask the Crew Chief to see the on-site safety program. We are very proud of it. It is a good practice to make sure any contractor you have doing work on your home has an on-sight written safety program as it is the law and lowers the risk of any possible problems.</p>
					
					<h3 id="question8">Maybe I should paint it myself. What do I need to do that?</h3>
					<p>If you would rather paint your home yourself, there are a few things to keep in mind: the retail paint cost (even with the discount we will give you) for an average 3 bedroom house will be between $500-600; the equipment necessary, brushes, rollers, drop clothes, ladders will have to be purchased and a paint sprayer rents at $60 a day. The time it will take if you're experienced and trained is roughly 50-60 hours of labor and that's our people following a system we've used and refined over the years.</p>
					
					<h3 id="question9">I Googled College Works Painting and found a number of negative comments. Why?</h3>
					<p>CWP stands behind its reputation as one of the top painting contractors in the country and celebrates its A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. However, as we've grown to over 8,000 customers a year, customer service errors are bound to happen the same as in any industry. While it is our policy to escalate customer concerns all the way to the CEO level if necessary to satisfy a customer, occasionally a dissatisfied customer will only talk to their local operator and not notify the corporate office when issues arise.</p>
