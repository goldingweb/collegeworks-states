						<p>For undergraduate students, College Works Painting provides a rare opportunity to build a competitive resume and gain valuable skills by teaching them how to run their very own--and very effective--painting business.</p>
						
						<p>And for you, the homeowner? When you use College Works Painting, you&rsquo;ll get quality workmanship at a fair price from a trusted company engaged in your community. You&rsquo;ll get great results with nothing but top national brand paints, a clean jobsite, and crews that are always energetic, polite and industrious.</p>
						
						<p>No matter what size the home or complex the project, it&rsquo;s all enshrined in our quality, workmanship, and material.</p>
						
						<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>
						<p>We're so confident in the work we do and products we use that we offer a three- to five-year guarantee on materials and a one- to five-year guarantee on labor, depending on how many finishing top coats we apply. Of course, no paint job is "bulletproof," and minor cracks or some peeling may occur. But an ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure. A quality paint job will last up to a decade if the proper preparation work and the best coatings are used. If you wish to extend the life of your paint job, call us. We'll gladly inspect your paint job annually and perform the necessary touch-ups, which on average take less than four hours, at a very reasonable price.</p>

							From the moment Christine knocked on our door early last spring inquiring if we needed a paint job to the final product, she was on top of everything. They were top-notch painters and worked tirelessly to complete the job and even included a few extra areas that they felt needed to be done to achieve painting perfection. Their cleanup was absolutely spotless!
