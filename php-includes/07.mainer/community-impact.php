					<p>College Works Painting contributes wholeheartedly to our local communities in many ways--with man hours, financial support, the collection of goods, and by requesting the avid participation of our customers and team members.</p>
					<p>In addition, each year our district managers perform &quot;Charity Paints&quot; nationwide, refinishing the houses of needy families.</p>
					<p>We also work with organizations to locate and set up other charity painting projects, and proudly support the following:</p>

					<p>In 2008, College Works Painting created a partnership with Augie's Quest, in hopes of helping Augie and Lynn Nieto achieve their dream of finding a cure for ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). Our customers contribute $5 from each project or each house they paint toward finding a cure for this horrible disease. We encourage you to visit the links below, find out more about Augie's Quest, and make additional donations.</p>
                    <p>What is Augie's Quest? Under the banner MDA's Augie's Quest, Nieto and his wife, Lynne, are supporting MDA's aggressive fundraising and research effort aimed at finding more effective treatments and, ultimately, a cure for ALS. MDA's ALS Division is the world leader among voluntary agencies in fighting ALS, offering the most comprehensive range of services, including a national network of clinics. MDA has dedicated more than $290 million to ALS research, services and education. MDA's Augie's Quest is solely dedicated to funding ALS research. Augie's Quest has raised more than $35 million in seven years, and 100 percent of all donations to MDA's Augie's Quest go directly to research.</p>
